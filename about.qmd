I received my PhD on talking-face biometric authentication from Telecom ParisTech (France) in 2007.

In 2008, I joined Dublin City University (Ireland) to work on video summarization techniques applied to user-generated content.

I am currently on leave from CNRS where I have been a permanent researcher since 2008, working almost exclusively on speaker diarization and related tasks. I am proud to be known as *"the guy behind [pyannote](https://www.github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio)"*

Since March 2025, I am Chief Science Officer and co-founder at [pyannoteAI](https://www.pyannote.ai).
