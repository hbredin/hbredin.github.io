## Biography

I received my PhD on talking-face biometric authentication from Telecom ParisTech (France) in 2007.

In 2008, I joined Dublin City University (Ireland) to work on video summarization techniques applied to user-generated content.

I have been a permanent CNRS researcher since 2008:

* at [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr) (Toulouse, France) in the SAMoVA group until 2010
* at [LIMSI](https://www.lisn.upsaclay.fr/) (Orsay, France) in the *Spoken Language Processing* group until 2020
* back at [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr) (Toulouse, France) until today

My current research interests include deep learning techniques applied to machine listening, with a strong focus on speaker diarization: I am proud to be known as *"the guy behind [pyannote](https://www.github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio)"*.

Since 2021, I have also started working as a self-employed scientific advisor and am [available](mailto:herve@niderb.fr) for contracting on topics related to my [academic research](https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/hbredin).
